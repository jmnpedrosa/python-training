# Python Training

## Introduction:

A collection of Python code and Jupyter Notebooks containing code samples and practice exercises for beginners in the Python language.

Contents are based on my own lecture notes for the online course [Complete Python Bootcamp: From Zero to Hero in Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/) by _Jose Portilla_. The language version is exclusively Python 3.

The complete notebooks written by the course's author are available in [Complete Python-3 Bootcamp](https://github.com/Pierian-Data/Complete-Python-3-Bootcamp).
